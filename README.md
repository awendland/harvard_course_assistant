## Synopsis

This is a basic boilerplate repo for a simple client side web application. It uses modern HTML5 standards and implements LESS for stylesheet rendering.

## Motivation

I created this project in order to streamline to process for getting quick demo projects up and running. My goal is to have this repo come with everything that I need to get a project running, but nothing more. I am not looking to include anything that would have to be removed in other projects, only common libraries will make there way in here.

## Installation

Simply:

	git clone git://github.com/awendland/simple-web-boilerplate.git PROJECT_NAME
	cd PROJECT_NAME
	git remote rm origin

## API Reference

This project currently includes:

 * Normalize 3.0.1
 * Less 2.0.0 (the JS client-side version)
 * Vanilla JS :), *modern web dev doesn't need jquery*
