## Motivation

I created this project to play with course data that I was able to extract from the CS 50 courses site. I was hoping to create a better interface for the Q Guide, but I've put my dreams on hold to work on other, potentially more useful, things.

## Installation

Simply:

	git clone https://github.com/awendland/harvard_course_assistant.git

This project can be easily served at <http://localhost:8000`> with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

## API Reference

This project currently includes:

 * Normalize 3.0.1
 * Less 2.0.0 (the JS client-side version)
 * Angular JS 1.4.4
